Performance Evaluation and Analysis of  Population-based Metaheuristics for Denoising of Biomedical Images

This repository consists of the codes used for the paper : Performance Evaluation and Analysis of  Population-based Metaheuristics for Denoising of Biomedical Images.
 The optimization algorithms are modelled to work on image data sets. The code for seven optimization algorithms studied in the paper as well as the main algorithm used for testing the efficacy is included in this repository.
